# Introduction

This Pattern Library has been developed with the <a href="http://astrum.nodividestudio.com/">Astrum</a> framework. The structure has been adapted to follow the <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a>, with atoms, molecules and organisms, introduced by Brad Frost.

The objective of this Pattern Library is to create a hub of user interface components of the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> landing page. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-examples-list">HubSpot's list</a> over the best landing page designs is just one out of many examples ranking the first impression of Shopify as an excellent user experience.

Furthermore, after the first month of Growth Hacking as UX Design Trainee with <a href="https://twitter.com/ginettateam?lang=en">Ginetta</a>, I learned the importance of compelling CTA's (call to actions) and intuitive, simple landing pages when striving for high user engagement. This key takeaway also influenced my choice of using a recognized landing page for my frontend project of Style Guide Design.
